Web Scraping Jazz Standards

This is my first personal, unguided data science project. In this web scraping project, I have created a dataset of 1000 jazz standards by retrieving data from the JazzStandards.com website using Python libraries Requests, Beautiful Soup, and cleaned, tabularized it using pandas and NumPy.

The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/melihcanyardi/jazz-standards).

The code I have written to to retrieve the data can be found in [Web Scraping Jazz Standards Notebook](https://github.com/melihcanyardi/web-scraping-jazz-standards/blob/main/Web%20Scraping%20Jazz%20Standards.ipynb).
